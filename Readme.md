# Directions EMEA 2019 Computer Vision Handwriting demo

This repository contains demo code for the Image Analysis (item tags, employee facial analysis) demo at Directions EMEA, Vienna 2019.

The code in here is pretty dirty and not representative of how you should write clean code. Since it was mostly hacked up in a hurry (because I spent a ridiculous amount of time preparing my LUIS demo) I didn't bother much to clean this repo up. Maybe, at some future point, but you know me.

# License and legalese

You are free to do whatever you want with this code as long as you don't blame me for anything (you may `git blame` me if you need to). Once you download and run this stuff, it's your responsibility, not mine.
